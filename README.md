# OUC-UAV-SEG

### News
- **2023.9.15** OUC-UAV-SEG released with all images and annotations for training and vallidation!
### Description
- Coastal ecosystems are crucial for maintaining a high-quality ecological environment and enriching marine biodiversity. However, there is currently an issue with the lack of comprehensive and detailed data support for the classification and zoning of coastal ecosystems.
- Due to the combined influence of natural environmental factors and human activities, the external morphology of coastal zones changes rapidly. The existing monitoring methods such as satellite remote sensing and conventional manual measurements, as well as ship-based operations, are no longer sufficient to meet the requirements for real-time observations.
- 
The OUC-UAV-SEG dataset comprises a total of 726 images, with 477 in the training set, 140 in the validation set, and 109 in the test set. However, it's important to note that **the annotations for the test set have not been made public**. You can use your own trained model for online evaluation on the [website](http://www.cvlab-ouc.cn/#/index).
